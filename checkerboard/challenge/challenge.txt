Assignment: Checkerboard
Objectives:
Continue to learn how to pass information from the url to the route
Practice linking static files to templates
Get comfortable passing information from the route to the template
Understand how to use for loop properly in the template
Recognize the value of creating a html/css first and then adding logic/code



Now let's practice linking static files to our template. For this project, we'll render a template that displays a checkerboard:



Your program should have the following output

http://localhost:5000 - should display 8 by 8 checkerboard
http://localhost:5000/4 - should display 8 by 4 checkerboard
http://localhost:5000/(x)/(y) - should display x by y checkerboard.  For example, http://localhost:5000/10/10 should display 10 by 10 checkerboard.  Before you pass x or y to Jinja, please remember to convert it to integer first (so that you can use x or y in a for loop)
HINT: Remember that values from urls come in as strings by default. If you want to use the value in a loop, you should convert it to an integer before passing it to Jinja.

After you've worked on this assignment for 45 minutes...
If you watch this video without first struggling on your own to do this assignment, this video won't add much value for you. Please first spend 45 minutes to complete the assignment on your own. After you've spent 45 minutes on your own, then please watch this video for some advice on approaching problems generally and some tips for this assignment particularly.

Note: In the video, we mention using an internal stylesheet. You know how to link static files, so practice using an external stylesheet!


Create a new Flask project

Have the root route render a template with a checkerboard on it

Have the css in a separate stylesheet and link this to the template

Have another route accept a single parameter (i.e. "/<x>") and render a checkerboard with x many rows, with alternating colors

NINJA BONUS: Have another route accept 2 parameters (i.e. "/<x>/<y>") and render a checkerboard with x rows and y columns, with alternating colors

SENSEI BONUS: Have another route accept 4 parameters (i.e. "/<x>/<y>/<color1>/<color2>") and render a checkerboard with x rows and y columns, with alternating colors, color1 and color2
